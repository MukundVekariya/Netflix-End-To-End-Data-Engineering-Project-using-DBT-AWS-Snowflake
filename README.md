# Netflix dbt Project

This repository contains a dbt (data build tool) project for analyzing Netflix data. It is fully containerized with Docker for easy setup, development, and deployment.

## 📊 Data Pipeline Architecture

![Netflix Data Pipeline Architecture](./pipeline-architecture.jpg)

**Explanation:**
- **Extract:** Netflix data is exported as CSV files.
- **Load:**
  - The CSV files are uploaded to AWS S3 (cloud storage).
  - From S3, the data is loaded into Snowflake (cloud data warehouse).
- **Transform:**
  - In Snowflake, the data is organized into staging and development schemas.
  - dbt (data build tool) is used for:
    1. **Data Transformation:** Cleans, joins, and models the raw data into analytics-ready tables.
    2. **Testing:** Ensures data quality and correctness.
    3. **Orchestration:** Manages dependencies and execution order of transformations.
- **Visualize:**
  - The transformed data is then available for BI tools like Tableau and Power BI for reporting and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **dbt**: Analytics engineering framework for transforming data in your warehouse
- **Warehouse**: Snowflake (configurable)
- **Dockerized**: Run anywhere, no local Python setup required

## 📁 dbt Folder Structure Explained

Your `netflix/` directory follows the standard dbt project structure. Here's what each key folder/file is for:

| Folder/File         | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `models/`           | Main dbt models (SQL transformations). Contains subfolders for dimensions (`dim/`), facts (`fct/`), marts (`mart/`), and staging (`staging/`). |
| `analyses/`         | Ad-hoc analysis SQL files not part of the main model DAG.               |
| `macros/`           | Custom Jinja macros (reusable SQL snippets/functions).                  |
| `seeds/`            | Static CSV data to load as tables (e.g., reference data).               |
| `snapshots/`        | Snapshot SQL files for tracking changes to records over time.           |
| `tests/`            | Custom data tests to ensure data quality.                               |
| `logs/`, `target/`  | dbt output and compiled files (not usually committed to git).           |
| `dbt_project.yml`   | Main configuration file for your dbt project.                           |
| `packages.yml`      | Lists dbt packages (like `dbt-utils`) your project depends on.          |
| `README.md`         | Project documentation.                                                  |

**This structure helps you organize your analytics code, keep transformations modular, and ensure data quality and documentation are built-in.**

## 🏁 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <repo-url>
cd Netflix-proj-1
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
```sh
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Snowflake credentials
```

### 3. Build and run with Docker Compose
```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up dbt-netflix
```

### 4. Run dbt commands
- Run all models: `docker-compose up dbt-netflix`
- Run tests: `docker-compose up dbt-test`
- Run specific model: `docker-compose run --rm dbt-netflix dbt run --select <model_name>`
- Open shell: `docker-compose run --rm dbt-netflix bash`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
- **Snowflake credentials**: Set in your `.env` file
- **dbt profiles**: Configured in `profiles.yml` (uses environment variables for secrets)
- **dbt packages**: Managed in `netflix/packages.yml` (e.g., dbt-utils)

---

## 🐳 Docker Usage
- All dbt commands can be run inside the container
- For development, mount your project directory for live editing
- See `README-Docker.md` for advanced Docker usage

---

## 🧪 Testing
Run dbt tests:
```sh
docker-compose up dbt-test
```

---

## 📝 Documentation
- [dbt Documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/)
- [Snowflake Setup](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/)
- See `README-Docker.md` for more Docker tips

---

## 🛡️ Security
- **Never commit real credentials** in `.env` or `profiles.yml`
- Use environment variables or Docker secrets for production
